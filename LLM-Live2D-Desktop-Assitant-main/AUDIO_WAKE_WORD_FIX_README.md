# Audio and Wake Word Detection Fixes

This document explains fixes applied to address audio playback errors and wake word detection issues.

## Audio Playback Fixes

The application was encountering "Failed to load because no supported source was found" errors when attempting to play audio. The following improvements have been made to `audio.js`:

1. **Multi-format Audio Support**: 
   - Now tries multiple formats (mp3, wav, mpeg, aac) sequentially
   - Falls back gracefully between formats if one fails

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better validation for dummy audio (`ZHVtbXkgYXVkaW8=`)
   - Graceful handling when audio data is invalid or too short
   - Detailed logging to identify specific failure points

3. **Audio Fallback System**:
   - Primary: Live2D model lip-sync audio playback
   - Secondary: Standard HTML5 Audio API with format detection
   - Final fallback: Simple beep sound using Web Audio API oscillator

## Wake Word Detection Fixes

There was an issue with missing wake word files, particularly `Elaina_en_wasm_v3_0_0.js`. The following improvements have been made:

1. **Graceful Script Loading**:
   - Desktop.html now checks if wake word files exist before trying to load them
   - Sets a flag to indicate English wake word availability

2. **Dynamic Wake Word Selection**:
   - VAD.js now checks file availability before attempting to use wake word files
   - Supports both Chinese and English wake words when available
   - Falls back to whatever wake word file is available

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Clear user feedback when wake word detection is unavailable
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Details

### Audio Format Detection

The improved system attempts multiple audio formats in sequence:
```javascript
// Try mp3 first, then wav, then other formats
tryPlayAudio("mp3")
    .catch(() => tryPlayAudio("wav"))
    .catch(() => tryPlayAudio("mpeg"))
    .catch(() => tryPlayAudio("aac"))
```

### Wake Word File Detection

The system now properly checks if wake word files exist:
```javascript
// Check file existence before trying to load
const chineseFileCheck = await fetch(chineseWakeWordFile, { method: 'HEAD' })
    .catch(() => ({ ok: false }));
    
if (chineseFileCheck.ok) {
    console.log("Chinese wake word file found");
    chineseAvailable = true;
    keywords.push({
        label: "伊蕾娜",
        publicPath: chineseWakeWordFile
    });
}
```

## Warnings That Can Be Ignored

Several warnings can be safely ignored:

1. **ONNX Runtime Warnings**: Messages like "Removing initializer '140'. It is not used by any node..." are optimization suggestions from the ONNX runtime, not actual errors.

2. **Electron Security Warning**: The warning about Content-Security-Policy is a development-mode warning that will not appear in packaged apps.
