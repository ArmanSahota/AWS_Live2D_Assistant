# Audio and Subtitle Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified
The audio and text responses from the backend were not playing in the frontend despite successful processing.

## Root Causes
1. **Property Name Mismatch**: Backend was sending `"expressions"` but frontend expected `"expression_list"`
2. **Message Type Mismatch**: Backend was sending `"type": "audio"` but frontend expected `"type": "audio-payload"`
3. **Audio Format Issue**: Backend was converting audio to WAV but MP3 files were being generated by TTS
4. **Missing Metadata**: Backend wasn't sending proper format information and slice_length was in wrong units

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Fix (`tts/stream_audio.py`)
- Changed message type from `"audio"` to `"audio-payload"`
- Changed property name from `"expressions"` to `"expression_list"`
- Added proper MP3 format detection and handling
- Fixed slice_length conversion (milliseconds to seconds)
- Added format metadata to payload

### 2. Frontend Fix (`static/desktop/audio.js`)
- Enhanced audio playback debugging
- Improved format detection with MP3 priority
- Added better error handling and logging
- Added subtitle cleanup after audio ends

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Start it again
   cd LLM-Live2D-Desktop-Assitant-main
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Reload the Frontend**:
   - The Electron app should automatically reconnect
   - If not, restart the Electron app

3. **Test Audio Playback**:
   - Speak into the microphone or type a message
   - You should now hear the audio response
   - Subtitles should appear during playback

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Backend sends `audio-payload` message type
- [ ] Audio data is properly base64 encoded
- [ ] Frontend receives and decodes audio
- [ ] Audio plays in MP3 format
- [ ] Subtitles display during playback
- [ ] No console errors related to audio playback

## Debug Logs to Check
Look for these in the console:
- `[AUDIO DEBUG] Received audio-payload message`
- `[AUDIO DEBUG] Adding audio task with text:`
- `[AUDIO DEBUG] MP3 audio started playing successfully`
- `[SUBTITLE DEBUG] Text updated:`

## Troubleshooting
If audio still doesn't play:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is sending MP3 files (check cache/tts folder)
3. Ensure WebSocket connection is stable
4. Check audio permissions in browser/Electron
