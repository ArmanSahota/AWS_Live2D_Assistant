# Speech-to-Text (STT) Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The STT functionality was not working because the `sendAudioPartition` function was missing from the desktop version of the application. This function is called by the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system when speech ends, but it didn't exist in `websocket.js`.

## Root Cause
- **Missing Function**: The `window.sendAudioPartition` function was being called in `vad.js` line 94, but was never defined
- **Incomplete Port**: The function existed in `web.html` but was not ported to the desktop version

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added `sendAudioPartition` function to `websocket.js`
```javascript
// Function to send audio data in chunks (missing function that VAD calls)
const chunkSize = 4096;
async function sendAudioPartition(audio) {
    console.log('[STT DEBUG] sendAudioPartition called with audio length:', audio ? audio.length : 0);
    
    if (!ws || ws.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
        console.error('[STT DEBUG] WebSocket not connected, cannot send audio');
        return;
    }
    
    if (!audio || audio.length === 0) {
        console.error('[STT DEBUG] No audio data to send');
        return;
    }
    
    // Log audio characteristics for debugging
    const audioMin = Math.min(...audio);
    const audioMax = Math.max(...audio);
    console.log(`[STT DEBUG] Audio amplitude range: ${audioMin.toFixed(4)} to ${audioMax.toFixed(4)}`);
    
    // Send audio in chunks
    let chunksSent = 0;
    for (let index = 0; index < audio.length; index += chunkSize) {
        const endIndex = Math.min(index + chunkSize, audio.length);
        const chunk = audio.slice(index, endIndex);
        
        // Convert to object format expected by server
        const chunkObject = {};
        for (let i = 0; i < chunk.length; i++) {
            chunkObject[i] = chunk[i];
        }
        
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({ 
            type: "mic-audio-data", 
            audio: chunkObject 
        }));
        chunksSent++;
    }
    
    console.log(`[STT DEBUG] Sent ${chunksSent} audio chunks`);
    
    // Send end signal
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "mic-audio-end" }));
    console.log('[STT DEBUG] Sent mic-audio-end signal');
}

// Make sendAudioPartition available globally
window.sendAudioPartition = sendAudioPartition;
```

### 2. Added Enhanced Logging
Added debug logging to track the audio pipeline:
- **Frontend (vad.js)**: Logs when speech ends and audio is sent
- **Frontend (websocket.js)**: Logs audio chunk details and transmission
- **Backend (server.py)**: Logs received audio chunks and buffer sizes

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the Application**:
   - Close the current application
   - Restart using your normal startup method

2. **Open Browser Console**:
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Go to the Console tab
   - Clear the console

3. **Test Speech Input**:
   - Click the microphone button or use the Test STT button
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - Stop speaking and wait

4. **Check Console Output**:
   You should see messages like:
   ```
   [STT DEBUG] Speech ended, audio length: [number]
   [STT DEBUG] sendAudioPartition called with audio length: [number]
   [STT DEBUG] Audio amplitude range: [min] to [max]
   [STT DEBUG] Sent [number] audio chunks
   [STT DEBUG] Sent mic-audio-end signal
   ```

5. **Check Server Terminal**:
   You should see messages like:
   ```
   [STT DEBUG] Received audio chunk: [number] samples, total buffer: [number] samples
   [STT DEBUG] Received audio data end from front end.
   [STT DEBUG] Processing audio buffer with [number] samples
   [STT DEBUG] Audio amplitude range: [min] to [max]
   ```

## Expected Behavior
After the fix:
1. When you speak, the VAD should detect speech start/end
2. Audio data should be sent to the server in chunks
3. The server should process the audio and convert it to text
4. The text should be sent to Claude for a response
5. Subtitles should display the conversation

## Troubleshooting
If it still doesn't work after the fix:

1. **Check WebSocket Connection**:
   - Look for "WebSocket connected successfully" in console
   - If not connected, check if server is running on the correct port

2. **Check Microphone Permissions**:
   - Browser should ask for microphone permission
   - Make sure it's granted

3. **Check Audio Input**:
   - The amplitude range should not be 0.0000 to 0.0000
   - If it is, check your microphone settings

4. **Check STT Service**:
   - Run the standalone STT test: `python test_stt.py`
   - If that works but the app doesn't, the issue is in the integration

## Files Modified
1. `static/desktop/websocket.js` - Added missing `sendAudioPartition` function
2. `static/desktop/vad.js` - Added debug logging
3. `server.py` - Added debug logging for audio reception
