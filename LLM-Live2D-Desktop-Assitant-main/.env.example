# WebSocket Server Configuration
# These environment variables control the WebSocket server and client connection

# WebSocket Host - The host address for the WebSocket server
# Default: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
# Change this if you need to bind to a different interface
WS_HOST=127.0.0.1

# WebSocket Port - The port number for the WebSocket server
# Default: 1017
# Change this if port 1017 is already in use
WS_PORT=1017

# WebSocket Path - The WebSocket endpoint path
# Default: /client-ws
# Change this if you need a different WebSocket endpoint
WS_PATH=/client-ws

# Alternative port configuration (fallback)
# PORT is used if WS_PORT is not set
PORT=1017

# Server Host Configuration (for server.py)
# SERVER_HOST in conf.yaml can also be used
# Default: 127.0.0.1
SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1

# Server Port Configuration (for server.py)
# SERVER_PORT in conf.yaml can also be used
# Default: 1017
SERVER_PORT=1017

# Frontend Environment Variables (for build-time configuration)
# These are used by the frontend WebSocket client
# Set these during build process or in your bundler configuration

# VITE_WS_HOST=127.0.0.1
# VITE_WS_PORT=1017
# VITE_WS_PATH=/client-ws

# Troubleshooting Notes:
# 
# 1. Port conflicts:
#    If you get "port already in use" errors, try changing WS_PORT to another value
#    Common alternatives: 1018, 1019, 1020, 8000, 8080, 3000
#
# 2. Connection refused:
#    Make sure both server and client are using the same host and port
#    Check firewall settings if connecting from different machines
#
# 3. WebSocket handshake errors:
#    Ensure the WS_PATH matches between server and client
#    Check that the server is actually running and accessible
#
# 4. To kill processes using a port (if needed):
#    Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :1017 && taskkill /PID <PID> /F
#    Linux/Mac: lsof -ti:1017 | xargs kill -9
