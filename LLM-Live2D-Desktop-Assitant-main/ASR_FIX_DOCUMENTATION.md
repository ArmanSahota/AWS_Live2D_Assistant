# ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The VTuber Assistant's speech recognition was completely broken because the Whisper ASR model couldn't initialize properly. The main issues were:

1. **Model Path Issue**: The ASR factory wasn't handling the model path parameter correctly
2. **Compute Type Issue**: The CPU compute type wasn't properly configured, causing initialization failures
3. **WebSocket Crashes**: When ASR failed, it would crash the WebSocket connection

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Model Path Configuration
- The configuration file had both `model_size` and `model_path` parameters
- The ASR factory was only looking for `model_path`, missing `model_size` as a fallback
- This could result in `None` being passed to the Whisper model initialization

### Issue 2: CPU Compute Type
- The original code tried to use `float16` compute type on CPU
- `float16` is not supported on CPU, only on CUDA devices
- This caused initialization failures with cryptic error messages

### Issue 3: Error Handling
- No validation for `None` model_path values
- No proper fallback for compute type failures
- Errors would propagate and crash the WebSocket connection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `asr/faster_whisper_asr.py`

**Changes made:**
- Added validation for `None` model_path with fallback to "base"
- Added `compute_type` parameter support with intelligent defaults
- Changed default compute type to `int8` for CPU compatibility
- Improved error handling with fallback compute types
- Added proper parameter passing to WhisperModel initialization
- Enhanced logging for debugging

**Key improvements:**
```python
# Added compute_type parameter and validation
def __init__(self, ..., compute_type: str = None):
    # Validate model_path
    if model_path is None:
        logger.warning("model_path is None, using default 'base'")
        model_path = "base"
    
    # Intelligent compute_type selection
    if compute_type is None:
        compute_type = "int8"  # CPU-compatible default
```

### 2. Fixed `asr/asr_factory.py`

**Changes made:**
- Added support for both `model_path` and `model_size` parameters
- Added `compute_type` parameter passing
- Improved parameter extraction from configuration

**Key improvements:**
```python
return FasterWhisperASR(
    model_path=kwargs.get("model_path") or kwargs.get("model_size"),
    compute_type=kwargs.get("compute_type"),
    # ... other parameters
)
```

### 3. Configuration File (`conf.yaml`)

The configuration now properly supports:
```yaml
ASR_MODEL: Faster-Whisper
Faster-Whisper:
  model_size: base      # Whisper model size
  model_path: base      # Alternative parameter name
  device: cpu           # Force CPU to avoid CUDA issues
  compute_type: int8    # CPU-compatible compute type
  language: en          # Target language
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_asr_fix.py`) was created to verify:
1. Configuration loading
2. ASR initialization
3. Model availability
4. Basic transcription functionality

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Configuration loads successfully
- ✅ ASR initializes without errors
- ✅ Model is properly instantiated
- ✅ Transcription function works (tested with silent audio)

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Ensure the fixed files are in place:**
   - `asr/faster_whisper_asr.py` - Updated with new initialization logic
   - `asr/asr_factory.py` - Updated with parameter handling
   - `conf.yaml` - Properly configured with correct parameters

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Start it again
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Verify the fix:**
   ```bash
   # Run the test script
   python test_asr_fix.py
   ```

4. **Test in the application:**
   - Open the VTuber application
   - Try speaking to test voice input
   - Check that transcription appears
   - Verify WebSocket connection remains stable

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Robust Initialization**: ASR now initializes reliably with proper fallbacks
2. **CPU Compatibility**: Correctly uses CPU-compatible compute types
3. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks prevent crashes
4. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify issues
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: Supports both `model_path` and `model_size` parameters

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the fix:

1. **Check Whisper Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade faster-whisper
   ```

2. **Verify Model Download:**
   - The first run may take time to download the model
   - Check internet connection if download fails

3. **Enable Verbose Logging:**
   - Set `VERBOSE: true` in `conf.yaml`
   - Check terminal output for detailed error messages

4. **Try Different Models:**
   - Change `model_size` to "tiny" for faster/lighter processing
   - Or "small", "medium", "large" for better accuracy

5. **Check System Resources:**
   - Ensure sufficient RAM (at least 4GB free)
   - Close other heavy applications

## Technical Details

### Whisper Model Sizes
- `tiny`: 39M parameters, ~1GB RAM
- `base`: 74M parameters, ~1.5GB RAM (default)
- `small`: 244M parameters, ~2GB RAM
- `medium`: 769M parameters, ~5GB RAM
- `large`: 1550M parameters, ~10GB RAM

### Compute Types for CPU
- `int8`: Best performance/accuracy trade-off (recommended)
- `float32`: Most accurate but slower
- `float16`: NOT supported on CPU (CUDA only)

### Language Support
- Set `language: en` for English
- Set `language: auto` for automatic detection
- Supports 99+ languages

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the critical ASR initialization issue that was preventing voice input from working in the VTuber Assistant. The solution provides robust error handling, CPU compatibility, and improved configuration flexibility. With these changes, the speech recognition component should work reliably across different systems and configurations.
